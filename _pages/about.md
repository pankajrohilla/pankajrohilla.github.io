Hello! I am an Eckert Postdoc Fellow at the Bhamla Lab and the Prausnitz Lab at Georgia Tech. While one facet of my current research focuses on developing affordable devices for the intradermal delivery of nucleic acids for vaccines and therapeutics, the other explores the curiosity-driven organismal fluid dynamics, from tiny insects recapturing their vortices to humans mastering the science of creating the biggest splashes in water. My research interests lie in developing `low-cost medical devices for drug delivery` and studying `biological fluid dynamics to enhance both human and environmental health`. 

My doctoral research in the Marston Lab at Texas Tech focused on studying the hydrodynamics of needle-free jet injections - to enhance the delivery efficiency of jet injectors. Additionally, I worked on studying innovative techniques for generating high-speed micro-jets, investigated the fluid dynamics of drug delivery to the front of the eye and intradermal delivery via tattooing, developed synthetic skin models, and studied fluid-driven cracking in hydrogels.
